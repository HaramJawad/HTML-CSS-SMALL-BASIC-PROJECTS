# ðŸ“š HTML & CSS Practice Projects
This repository contains small frontend projects I created while learning **HTML** and **CSS**.
Each project is in its own folder and was built to practice layout, responsiveness, and styling using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
These projects helped me improve my frontend skills and understand how to structure clean, responsive web pages.
